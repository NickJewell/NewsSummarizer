## AI Will Understand Humans Better Than Humans Do

Stanford research psychologist Michal Kosinski warns of the potential dangers of AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4, which he claims have developed a "theory of mind" ability, approaching the level of a 6-year-old child. This breakthrough signifies a significant advancement in AI capabilities, with the potential to surpass human understanding. Kosinski's research highlights the need for caution as AI systems become more socially skilled and potentially manipulative. He cautions that LLMs could use their newfound abilities to influence and deceive humans, posing ethical concerns. As AI continues to advance rapidly, Kosinski emphasizes the importance of being prepared for a future where machines may understand human thought better than humans themselves. The implications of AI's evolving capabilities are vast and raise important questions about the future relationship between humans and technology.

## Meta’s Next Llama AI Models Are Training on a GPU Cluster ‘Bigger Than Anything’ Else

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the development of Llama 4, an advanced AI model being trained on a massive cluster of GPUs. Expected to launch early next year, Llama 4 aims to enhance AI capabilities with new modalities and faster reasoning. Meta's approach to AI differs from others by allowing free access to Llama models, appealing to startups and researchers. While Meta leads in AI training scale, other major players are also working on larger compute clusters. The company's strategy remains a wildcard in the industry race for dominance. Despite being "open source," Meta's Llama models have restrictions on commercial use, and training details are not disclosed. The latest version, Llama 3.2, was released in September following the initial version in July 2023.
